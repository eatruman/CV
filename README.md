## Liz Truman


I am an ambitious and enthusiastic **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for an interesting role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge and gain exposure to project management and buisness strategy. After graduating from university in Canada, I packed my entire life into two suitcases and moved to the UK to begin my career. After seven years working in education I realized I had hit a plateau, I wasn't learning anything new or finding myself challenged anymore so decided to try my hand at a new skill - coding! Having recently completed the intensive 12 week programme of Makers Academy, I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer. Learning to code has enabeled me to flex my determination and perseverance muscles whilst spending my days doing my favourite thing - problem solving!

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

### Iniative 

#### Communication

As a teacher I demonstrated strong communication skills daily. I could cofidently present student data and predictions in progress meetings with head teachers and executive leadership teams and then swap to teaching my class a song about the six wives of Henry the 8th with less than two minutes turnaround time ( divorced, beheaded, and died, divorced. beheaded, survived! in case you're wondering.) I am excellent at using my interpersonal skills to develop relationships with others which leads to efficient teamwork and an enjoyable working environment. 

- Evidence

#### Fast Learner

My superpower is my ability to ask questions. I love learning. I use my superpower to improve my understanding of new concepts and to develop new skills. 

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
